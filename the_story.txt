Once upon a time


Tottenham Hotspur is top of the Premiere League
The Premiere League is the toughest league in England
I walked into Lafferre
in order to get to my CS4450 lecture
And fell down the stairs
There was a CS student named Noah,
And he forgot to set up vim properly on his new computer so it looks and acts all wrong but it's fine he's doing fine.
but it looks like Noah figured it out.
There was a Frog named Kermit.
He was a genius Software Engineer in the Frog Kingdom. 
One day kermit met a pirate named Monkey D. Luffy.
Luffy gave Kermit a Frog-Frog fruit which turned him into a frog.

The end.
