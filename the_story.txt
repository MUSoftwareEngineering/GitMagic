Once upon a time


It was cold. 
So cold, that the people feared they would not be able to make it through the winter.
Upon the ramparts of Fort Lafferre, a guild of adventurers lived.
The adventurers were very cold.

They where bold and returning. 
They ate and drank merrily, indulging in the rewards earned by their bravery.
For they had slayed a dragon!
They enjoyed their night thoroughly, knowing they would be given their next quest in the morning.
They celebrated while they could, for their next quest was one of great peril.
And in the morning the great wizard woke.
With a great belowing voice a new quest he had spoke.
He told the adventurers to rescue Princess Fiona.
And the adventurers responded, "AYE AYE, CAPTAIN!"
And the bellowing voice said, "I CAN'T HEAR YOU!"

The end.
