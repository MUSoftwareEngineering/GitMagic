in order to get to my CS4450 lecture
There was a seaside town that was destroyed by a cataclysm and consequently sunk into the depths of the earth.
And fell down the stairs
There was a CS student named Noah,
And he forgot to set up vim properly on his new computer so it looks and acts all wrong but it's fine he's doing fine.
but it looks like Noah figured it out.
I never saw Noah again.
Noah must have died.
There was a Frog named Kermit.
He was a genius Software Engineer in the Frog Kingdom. 
Yet he had to be carried through CS3050
Saab's quizes gave Kermit PTSD.
One day kermit met a pirate named Monkey D. Luffy.
An individual was told about the fortunes of the lost kingdom fabled to exist in the ruins of the old town.
Luffy gave Kermit a Frog-Frog fruit which turned him into a frog.
Kermit was very happy as a frog.
He solved many of the Frog Kingdom's problems with his ingenious software while in frog form.
Kermit has multiple statues in the frog kingdom.
There was also a student named Sneha.
She was always Reddy.
Once upon a time there was a dude named Reese
That's the end of my story. 
There was a boy whose name was Momotaro
He was born out of a big peach
However, she was never really ready.
One would say, a late-y.
There once was a man from Nantucket. 
My phone autocorrected to duck it. 
My shirt was loose so I had to tuck it.
