Once upon a time


It was cold. 
So cold, that the people feared they would not be able to make it through the winter.
Upon the ramparts of Fort Lafferre, a guild of adventurers lived.
The adventurers were very cold.

They where bold and returning. 
They ate and drank merrily, indulging in the rewards earned by their bravery.
For they had slayed a dragon!
They enjoyed their night thoroughly, knowing they would be given their next quest in the morning.
They celebrated while they could, for their next quest was one of great peril.
And in the morning the great wizard woke.
With a great belowing voice a new quest he had spoke.
He told the adventurers to rescue Princess Fiona.
Princess Fiona had been locked in the highest room in the tallest tour for years waiting for the time that someone came to rescue her, and that time is now.
And the adventurers responded, "AYE AYE, CAPTAIN!"
And the bellowing voice said, "I CAN'T HEAR YOU!"
The adventurers said to the wizard that he needed to get better ears.
But in response to those rude adventurers, he struck them with lightning, turning them into Capybaras.
As we all know, Capybaras are the world's largest rodent, but they also LOVE sitting in warm water!

The end.
