Once upon a time

Tottenham Hotspur is top of the Premier League.
However, Tottenham is a mid club and will finish near the bottom of the table ;)
The Premier League is the toughest league in England.
I walked into Lafferre.
And fell down the stairs.
in order to get to my CS4450 lecture
There was a seaside town that was destroyed by a cataclysm and consequently sunk into the depths of the earth.
There was a CS student named Noah,
And he forgot to set up vim properly on his new computer so it looks and acts all wrong but it's fine he's doing fine.
but it looks like Noah figured it out.
There was a Frog named Kermit.
He was a genius Software Engineer in the Frog Kingdom. 
Yet he had to be carried through CS3050
One day kermit met a pirate named Monkey D. Luffy.
An individual was told about the fortunes of the lost kingdom fabled to exist in the ruins of the old town.
Luffy gave Kermit a Frog-Frog fruit which turned him into a frog.
There was also a student named Sneha.
She was always Reddy.
However, she was never ready.
More like late-y.

The end.
