

Once upon a time


A boy and his dog were walking through the park when they encountered a cat.


The cat started at him


He stared at the cat.


The cat gave him a sly wink.



It started to walk towards the dog


The dog began to bark at the cat.


The cat continued strolling towards the dog confidently.


A dog realized that he is a dog.


He began to question everything he knew, like the cat was playing some kind of mind game.


'What even is a dog?' he pondered to himself.


He recalled the cat he saw in a dark corner.


The two cats were NOT the same cats.


The cats were fast asleep.



The cats, curled into balls of fur, dreamt of catching mice.


At this moment, a bird flying over.


The bird is yellow.



She is looking at the dog.


The bird dropped him some donuts.


The dog ate too many donuts and threw up.

Following the bird was a hawk.




The dog wiped it's eyes.



It wasn't actually a bird, it was superman.


Superman looked down upon the crowd and said.



Next time let me into the GitHub repo my friend.


The bird decided that they wanted to rest.


They flew down and decided to take a rest next to the cat.


The cat was hungry.


But it wanted to eat a mouse, not a kryptonian.


The cat wandered around around, but he couldn't find a mouse anywhere.


He is so hungry, and he turned his eye to Superman.


The cat noticed a mouse in a dark alley.



The cat pounced on it, ready to eat. 


The dog looked at the bird in the tree.

Then the dog flew to the tree.


The end.
