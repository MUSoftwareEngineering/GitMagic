Once upon a time



In a land far far away... 


A boy and his dog were walking through the park when they encountered a cat.


And the sky turned dark.


The boy became distracted by the dark, looming clouds.


He approached it slowly.


The cat started at him


He stared at the cat.


The cat gave him a sly wink.


It was very clear something was about to go down.


Another cat emerged from a nearby tree


One cat was way active and another one was sitting quietly.


It started to rain.
It was raining so loud you could feel everything was going to fall apart.





It started to walk towards the dog


He then moved into the details.


The dog began to bark at the cat.


The boy was too enthralled by the storm to notice.


The cat continued strolling towards the dog confidently.


A dog realized that he is a dog.


He began to question everything he knew, like the cat was playing some kind of mind game.


'What even is a dog?' he pondered to himself.


He recalled the cat he saw in a dark corner.


The two cats were NOT the same cats.


The cats were fast asleep.



The cats, curled into balls of fur, dreamt of catching mice.


At this moment, a bird flying over.


The bird is yellow.


The bird was also very large.


He had a random migraine


She is looking at the dog.


The bird dropped him some donuts.


The dog became distracted by a box of donuts left on the ground.


She is looking at the dog.


It stopped raining.

It made the boy shiver.

It just so happened that at that very moment, Mercury was in retrograde.

The dog ate too many donuts and threw up.

Following the bird was a hawk.

The hawk considered becoming involved in the story but realized that there were already too many characters and flew away.The hawk suddenly disappeared into the space-time contiuum, never to be seen again.


The dog wiped its eyes

It wasn't actually a bird, it was superman.

Superman looked down upon the crowd and said.



Next time let me into the GitHub repo my friend.


The bird decided that they wanted to rest.


They flew down and decided to take a rest next to the cat.


This awakened the cat.


The boy sat up in bed, his dog lay at his feet and the cat perched on his dresser.

And the cat was not pleased that he was awakened.

The cat stared longingly at the bird for a moment, then ate it.


The cat was hungry.


But it wanted to eat a mouse, not a kryptonian.


The cat wandered around around, but he couldn't find a mouse anywhere.


He is so hungry, and he turned his eye to Superman.


Superman left without hesitation.


The boy wondered why this had happened.


The cat noticed a mouse in a dark alley.



The cat pounced on it, ready to eat. 


But the cat missed, and the mouse got away.


The dog looked at the bird in the tree.

Then the dog flew to the tree.

The dog landed on a branch.


The branch broke under his weight.
But there was no logical explanation


I poured spot remover on the dog.


The Dog vanishes into the space-time continuum, perhaps to be seen again.


Now he's gone.


Now we will embark on a seperate journey, one of great loss and triumph. But we'll be back to our animal friends soon enough


There was a frog named named bill



Bill was a strong frog 


Bill went to the store.


He bought some cereal.


It was his favorite kind.


The cereal had flies in it.


Then he went to the register.


He presented a coupon to get the cereal for half-off.


There were tic-tacs at the counter


He bought some tic-tacs.


He read the nutritional information on the back of the package.

Wow! 0 calories per serving. He ate all of the tic-tacs at once.


Bill found those tic-tacs delicious.



But what Bill didn't know was that companies can round down to the nearest multiple of 5 for calories, so he actually ingested a lot of calories for a frog.
He grew so strong that he became an Olympian.
He won a gold medal for rowing.
And a gold metal for making gold metals.

Then, Bill made some cereal.

Bill the frog leaped out of the store into outer space with his newly found strength.


Bill began flying through space at light speed.



Deep in the cosmos, he met his arch-nemesis once again.


The moral of the story is as follows: 

His arch-nemises was the frog prince.
The frog prince was named Henry.
Just kidding, the frong prince was made up. Frogs aren't princes! Henry was actually a pickle.


Henry was not happy to seem him.
Out of nowhere a cat named Leonard appeard.


Leanard was an Orange Cat.



We interrupt this story for a message from our sponsor: Raid Shadow Legends.

Henry brutally beat Leonard to death.

As Leonard hit the floor, Henry let out a bloodcurdling scream of joy.


Henry doesn't like cats.
Henry has killed every cat that he has encountered in the cosmos.

Henry started furiously enacting the dougie from the hit song Teach Me How to Dougie by Cali Swag District.

Henry's enthusiasm and energy reanimated Leonard, and they both started dougie-ing in sync. 

The end.
