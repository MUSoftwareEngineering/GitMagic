Once upon a time

<<<<<<< HEAD
There was an avaricious serpent who tormented the land by swallowing up every GPU before anyone could purchase one.
The King used his powers to slay the serpent.
The serpent came back to life as a friendly dog.
The King loved his new dog.
Tottenham Hotspur is top of the Premier League.
However, Tottenham is a mid club and will finish near the bottom of the table ;)
The Premier League is the toughest league in England.
I walked into Lafferre
in order to get to my CS4450 lecture
There was a seaside town that was destroyed by a cataclysm and consequently sunk into the depths of the earth.
And fell down the stairs
Then I ordered the Chalupa Supreme from Taco Bell.
P.S. This is mentioned because the Chalupa Supreme lives up to its name, not at all because of a promotional deal from Taco Bell.
The gates of heaven were opened and I was blinded by its light.
But then my eyes adjusted and I saw several figures standing before me.
There was a CS student named Noah,
And he forgot to set up vim properly on his new computer so it looks and acts all wrong but it's fine he's doing fine.
but it looks like Noah figured it out.
I never saw Noah again.
Until one day he reappeared in CS4320.
(Noah had acne).
I looked at his computer and he was using Emacs.
There was a Frog named Kermit.
He was a genius Software Engineer in the Frog Kingdom. 
Yet he had to be carried through CS3050
Saab's quizes gave Kermit PTSD.
Apparently it's not easy being a red-black tree.
One day kermit met a pirate named Monkey D. Luffy.
His manner was a little bit stuffy.
An individual was told about the fortunes of the lost kingdom fabled to exist in the ruins of the old town.
Luffy gave Kermit a Frog-Frog fruit which turned him into a frog.
Kermit was very happy as a frog.
He solved many of the Frog Kingdom's problems with his ingenious software while in frog form.
Kermit has multiple statues in the frog kingdom.
Unfortunately, most of the statues were lost in the great frog wars of the Second Age.
There was also a student named Sneha.
She was always Reddy.
Once upon a time there was a dude named Reese
That's the end of my story. 
There was a boy whose name was Momotaro
He was born out of a big peach
However, she was never really ready.
One would say, a late-y.
There once was a man from Nantucket. 
He drinks gatorade from a bucket.
My phone autocorrected to duck it. 
There was a great big moose!
His favorite color was chartreuse.
He liked to drink a lot of juice.
The moose's name was Fred.
He liked to drink his juice in bed.
And sometimes he would also put milk on his head.
Or so it has been said.
Fred was walking home on a bit of a gloomy day.
When he turned the corner, he suddenly saw what a lake of juice - his favorite, too.
Not only was it just a lake of juice but a lake full of cereal fish.
The cereal fish were all Frosted Flakes.
And Tony the Tiger was always hunting the fish.
Fred wanted the cereal fish, but Tony wasn't going to give them up easily.
An epic battle ensued, one that would change the fate of humanity.
Fred was surrounded by a strange light, and when he woke up, he found himself in front of the Scarlet Devil Mansion.
There is a strange maid in the Scarlet Devil Mansion, named Sakuya Izayoi.
And then it started raining.
And it didnt't stop raining for days.

It was cold. 
So cold, that the people feared they would not be able to make it through the winter.
Upon the ramparts of Fort Lafferre, a guild of adventurers lived.
The adventurers were very cold.
Fort Lafferre was very beautiful this time of year though.
They where bold and returning. 
The cold didn't bother them, however, as their spirits were high.
They ate and drank merrily, indulging in the rewards earned by their bravery.
For they had slayed a dragon!
A dragon with blood red scales, and a black barbed tail.
They enjoyed their night thoroughly, knowing they would be given their next quest in the morning.
They celebrated while they could, for their next quest was one of great peril.
And in the morning the great wizard woke.
With a great belowing voice a new quest he had spoke.
He told the adventurers to rescue Princess Fiona.
Princess Fiona had been locked in the highest room in the tallest tour for years waiting for the time that someone came to rescue her, and that time is now.
And the adventurers responded, "AYE AYE, CAPTAIN!"
And the bellowing voice said, "I CAN'T HEAR YOU!"
The adventurers said to the wizard that he needed to get better ears.
But in response to those rude adventurers, he struck them with lightning, turning them into Capybaras.
As we all know, Capybaras are the world's largest rodent, but they also LOVE sitting in warm water!
He wasn't trying to turn them into Capybaras, he was trying to electrocute them, but such is the life of a wizard.
The Capybaras squealed and grunted, running circles around the wizard until he grew tired and turned them back.
The adventurers, now human once again, continued on their journey to find the princess.
They plotted revenge on the wizard while they traveled.
Days into their journey, they spotted it. The evil structure where the princess was being held.
The structure was surrounded by a moat of lava, and being guarded by a dragon.
Cross the moat, they must, and so they ran across a drawbridge, hand in hand.
The dragon looked rather plump and sedentary, so the adventurers thought up a plan
They brought the dragon peperroni pizza and fancy wine.
The dragon drank the wine and ate the pizza, growing drowsy.
The inebriated dragon's eyelids drooped and head stooped from the wine and full belly
On this island of peaches, there lived a girl too.
And though none knew, she was the princess past the dragon they were supposed to slew.
The girl challenged the Lafferre Guild champion to a cybersecurity duel.
The dragon decided to take a long nap
She was smart and quick-witted, and managed to escape them both to the mainland.
The adventurers rejoiced, for their scheme had been successful.
But after only a few hours of napping the dragon was suddenly woken
Quickly, the adventurers hatched a plan.
Then they called to the princess to bring them her girdle.
With this they bound the dragon fast, and gave the end of the girdle into her hand, and the subdued monster crawled after them like a dog.
While the girdle bought our fated hero's some time, the dragon was right on their tail.
Suddenly, the princess trips and falls.
Her slipper soars through the air.
The princess becomes very distraught about her pure gold slipper
Thankfully, the princess looked up, and saw her slipper flying back down to the ground.
Unfortunately, the slipper continued falling and landed directly on her face. Ouch.
The slipper hit her so hard on the head.
That she now has a fractured skull.
However, the princess was unfazed!
The princess had been blessed with a thick head.
Suddenly, the dragon broke through the adventurers' plasma shields.
A passing peasant wondered where the plot went.
She continued her journey and made sure that nothing else would get in her way.
After awaking, there was a man with lush long dark red hair standing before her.
Struggling to stay conscious, the princess considered that given the events of today, waking up in the company of a stange man with a robust head of hair wasn't the worst outcome.
He then picked her up, and put her on his might steed.Until she fell again.
And her gold slipper flew back into the sky.
It would seem that the slipper had done more than just crack open her head, and left the princess with a damaged brain.
A minor case of serious brain damage.
She was cheerfully unaware that her heroic friends were screaming on mute as the dragon severed their networks.
The courageous heroes could not fix their networks, and had no mobile data here.
The man with the lush long dark red hair, quickly rushed to catch her slipper before it was smashed into the ground.
But while running to catch it he tripped and fell and the slipper also hit him on the head.
The man with the red hair shriecked and the whole kingdom heard his pain.
He took his last look at life and fell unconcious.
Once the princess had regained consciousness, she saddled her horse with the dying red haired man
The princess, upon seeing seeing his death, considered her options, and passed out again.
The adventurers wondered if the princess was worth saving.
Oh, what a woeful sight it was.  The princess was gleefully riding along with her horse while the man with the most gorgeous, silky, red hair you've ever seen, was bleeding out next to her.
While this was happening the dragon was breaking through the lines of adventurers sent to defend her.
It roared, sending all but the bravest aback!
As the dragon swiftly approached, her demise seemed imminent as only one person was standing between her and the dragon.
Luckily, that person was Sean Goggins, the Bulwark of the Lafferre Guild.
The weary traveller looked into the sky and realized it might rain.
Sean was a mighty warrior, one who could best the dragon with a single swing of his sword
He approached the dragon alone, ready to defend the rest.
Goggins was the only person left that could stop the dragon.
This was because he possessed the thing that the dragon feared most.
The greatly feared but ever-present macbook that rampantly terrorizes the lecture halls of many cs classes.
"OH MY GOD! HE'S GONNA CODE THE DRAGON AWAY," yelled the princess.
<<<<<<< HEAD
With a single flick, he opened his laptop and began to type.
=======
She could hardly contain herself.
He wondered when his journey would finally be over.
To accompany the macbook, he pulled out a rainbow colored mechanical keyboard.
(The keyboard also doubled as an electric guitar.)
Through the power of programming, Goggins stood up to the dragon.
Goggins multiplexed the universe's mainframe into a remote access trojan vector matrix and uninstalled the dragon from existence.

Goggins some how slayed the dragon. pleased with his success he took the dragon head as a trophy for his newly finished garage.
<<<<<<< HEAD
Turning to the princess he held out his hand."Zip the two files together and submit to canvas before the due date," he whispered.

Turning to the princess he held out his hand.
<<<<<<< HEAD
 All the sudden, a knight appeared out of nowhere!
 He offered me cookies and milk... how could I turn that down?

=======
The princess grabbed his hand and rose from the ground.
He dusted her off, decided she looked good enough to walk, and left for his new garage.
The garage had recently been reforged, you see.
Inside his garage he kept all of his favorite weapons.
He grabbed his favorite weapon to show the princess.
"Behold, the famed conking stick, with which I conk my enemies in the head!" He exclaimed.
When the princess didn't respond, Goggins looked up to notice she had gone cross-eyed; perhaps the brain damage had set in.
Goggins, knowing she had passed out took her to the local physician.
The local physician, Roland Oruche told Goggins that there was a special procedure but it was very risky.
If they suplexed her, they could dislodge the while(1) loop running in her prefrontal cortex.
Goggins agreed and let the doctor suplex her.
The doctor performed a most brilliant suplex.

The end.
