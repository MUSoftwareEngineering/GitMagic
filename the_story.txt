Once upon a time

The King used his powers to slay the serpent.
The serpent came back to life as a friendly dog.
The King loved his new dog.
Tottenham Hotspur is top of the Premier League.
However, Tottenham is a mid club and will finish near the bottom of the table ;)
The Premier League is the toughest league in England.
I walked into Lafferre
in order to get to my CS4450 lecture
There was a seaside town that was destroyed by a cataclysm and consequently sunk into the depths of the earth.
And fell down the stairs
There was a CS student named Noah,
And he forgot to set up vim properly on his new computer so it looks and acts all wrong but it's fine he's doing fine.
but it looks like Noah figured it out.
I never saw Noah again.
Until one day he reappeared in CS4320.
I looked at his computer and he was using Emacs.
There was a Frog named Kermit.
He was a genius Software Engineer in the Frog Kingdom. 
Yet he had to be carried through CS3050
Saab's quizes gave Kermit PTSD.
Apparently it's not easy being a red-black tree.
One day kermit met a pirate named Monkey D. Luffy.
An individual was told about the fortunes of the lost kingdom fabled to exist in the ruins of the old town.
Luffy gave Kermit a Frog-Frog fruit which turned him into a frog.
Kermit was very happy as a frog.
He solved many of the Frog Kingdom's problems with his ingenious software while in frog form.
Kermit has multiple statues in the frog kingdom.
Unfortunately, most of the statues were lost in the great frog wars of the Second Age.
There was also a student named Sneha.
She was always Reddy.
Once upon a time there was a dude named Reese
That's the end of my story. 
There was a boy whose name was Momotaro
He was born out of a big peach
However, she was never really ready.
One would say, a late-y.
There once was a man from Nantucket. 
My phone autocorrected to duck it. 
At least it did not auto correct to something else,
Otherwise I could be in some real trouble.

The end.
