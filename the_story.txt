Once upon a time


It was cold. 
So cold, that the people feared they would not be able to make it through the winter.
Upon the ramparts of Fort Lafferre, a guild of adventurers lived.
The adventurers were very cold.

They where bold and returning. 
They ate and drank merrily, indulging in the rewards earned by their bravery.
For they had slayed a dragon!
A dragon with blood red scales, and a black barbed tail.
They enjoyed their night thoroughly, knowing they would be given their next quest in the morning.
They celebrated while they could, for their next quest was one of great peril.
And in the morning the great wizard woke.
With a great belowing voice a new quest he had spoke.
He told the adventurers to rescue Princess Fiona.
And the adventurers responded, "AYE AYE, CAPTAIN!"
And the bellowing voice said, "I CAN'T HEAR YOU!"
The adventurers said to the wizard that he needed to get better ears.
But in response to those rude adventurers, he struck them with lightning, turning them into Capybaras.
He wasn't trying to turn them into Capybaras, he was trying to electrocute them, but such is the life of a wizard.
The Capybaras squealed and grunted, running circles around the wizard until he grew tired and turned them back.
The adventurers, now human once again, continued on their journey to find the princess.
Days into their journey, they spotted it. The evil structure where the princess was being held.
The structure was surrounded by a moat of lava, and being guarded by a dragon.
They brought the dragon peperroni pizza and fancy wine.
The dragon drank the wine and ate the pizza, growing drowsy.
On this island of peaches, there lived a girl too.
The dragon decided to take a long nap
She was smart and quick-witted, and managed to escape them both to the mainland.
The adventurers rejoiced, for their scheme had been successful.
But after only a few hours of napping the dragon was suddenly woken
Quickly, the adventurers hatched a plan.
Then they called to the princess to bring them her girdle.
With this they bound the dragon fast, and gave the end of the girdle into her hand, and the subdued monster crawled after them like a dog.
While the girdle bought our fated hero's some time, the dragon was right on their tail.
Suddenly, the princess trips and falls.
Her slipper soars through the air.
The princess becomes very distraught about her pure gold slipper

The end.
